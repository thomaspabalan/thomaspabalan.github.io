                <p class="paragraph">
                    Following a challenging competition against fellow students aspiring for the title of the next king, Thomas Ciubal, 
                    a delegate from the College of Computer Studies, achieved the remarkable distinction of 2nd Runner-up at the 
                    recently concluded Mr. and Ms. TSU 2023 on October 18th, held at TSU Gymnasium.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Ciubal's path to success was guided by a set of values instilled in him by the dedicated educators at our university. 
                    He expressed deep gratitude for their tireless efforts, particularly on the occasion of #WorldTeachersDay, during 
                    the QnA segment. It was with unwavering determination, boundless passion, unyielding commitment, and sheer 
                    perseverance that Ciubal excelled during the event.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    "Determination is my driving force; I never surrender. Passion fuels my every endeavor, as I consistently give my 
                    best. Perseverance is my strength; no matter the challenges, I persist, push through, and continue the fight," he 
                    emphasized when asked to describe the value that best characterizes his role as a dedicated student of our university.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Ciubal also received the prestigious Best in Talent Award for his captivating shadow play performance, which was 
                    based on Freddie Aguilar's renowned song "Anak." He aims to serve as a role model and an inspiration for fellow 
                    students, encouraging them to emulate his journey and achievements.
