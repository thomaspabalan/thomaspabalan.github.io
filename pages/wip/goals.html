                    What is my vision for the website in the final term? I envision the final version of this website to be a
                    pseudo-portal of sorts. Something akin to the current student portal, but simpler and has the main website
                    integrated into it instead of on a separate domain like it currently is in our real life portal. It should 
                    be able to do the following:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide a unified website for visitors, students, and faculty alike.</li>
                    <li>Provide login functionality for students and faculty.</li>
                    <li>Visitors should be able to see basic information about the university such as the news, available courses, 
                        contacts, and some background about the university.</li>
                    <li>Students should be able to access functions and tools related to their work, and the same should
                        also apply to the faculty.</li>
                    <li>The website should be simple and easy to navigate.</li>
                    <li>The website should be coded in such a way that adding and modifying features such as HTML and CSS 
                        is easy and does not break any existing functionality.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    If all the goals stated above are met, then I can say that I have successfully achieved the dream vision of my 
                    website. I can say then that the project of creating a pseudo-portal for the fictional 'Thomas State University'
                    has now been finished.
