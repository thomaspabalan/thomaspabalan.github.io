                <p class="paragraph">
                    In 1906, a visionary by the name of T.C. Pabalan embarked on an extraordinary educational journey that would 
                    forever change the landscape of higher learning. Pabalan's dream was to establish a place where practical skills 
                    and knowledge would converge, thus giving birth to what would become Thomas State University.
